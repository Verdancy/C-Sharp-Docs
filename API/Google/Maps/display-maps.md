### Display maps on your application

To display a map in C# using the Google Maps API, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Set up a project in the Google Cloud Console and obtain an API key.
2. Install the Google Maps API client library for C#. You can do this using the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio or by downloading the library from nuget.org.
3. Create a new C# Windows Forms application and include the necessary using statements for the Google Maps API client library.
4. In your application, create a new GMapControl object and set the API key that you obtained in step 1.
5. Set the map provider and center the map on a specific location by setting the MapProvider and Position properties of the GMapControl object. You can also set the Zoom level by setting the Zoom property.
6. Add the GMapControl object to your form by dragging it from the Toolbox onto the form in the designer, or by adding it programmatically in the form's constructor.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to display a basic map in a C# Windows Forms application using the Google Maps API:


```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using GMap.NET;
using GMap.NET.MapProviders;

namespace GoogleMapsAPI
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            // Set the API key.
            GMap.NET.GMaps.Instance.ApiKey = "API_KEY"; // Replace "API_KEY" with your own API key.

            // Set the map provider and center the map on a specific location.
            gMapControl1.MapProvider = GoogleMapProvider.Instance;
            gMapControl1.Position = new PointLatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // Coordinates for San Francisco, CA.
            gMapControl1.Zoom = 12;
        }
    }
}
```

This code will display a basic map in a Windows Forms application, centered on the specified location and with a default zoom level of 12. You can customize the code to add additional functionality or modify the appearance of the map.
