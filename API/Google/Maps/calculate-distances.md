### Calculate distances and times between locations

Here is the revised code that demonstrates how to calculate distances and times between locations in C# using the Google Maps API:


```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using GMap.NET;
using GMap.NET.MapProviders;

namespace GoogleMapsAPI
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            // Set the API key.
            GMap.NET.GMaps.Instance.ApiKey = "API_KEY"; // Replace "API_KEY" with your own API key.

            // Calculate the distance between two locations.
            PointLatLng startLocation = new PointLatLng(37.7749, -122.4194); // Coordinates for San Francisco, CA.
            PointLatLng endLocation = new PointLatLng(37.7972, -122.4533); // Coordinates for Oakland, CA.
            var distance = GoogleMapProvider.Instance.GetDistance(startLocation, endLocation, false);
            Console.WriteLine("Distance: " + distance.distance + " meters");
            
            // Calculate the duration of a route between two locations.
            string mode = "driving"; // Possible values: "driving", "walking", "bicycling", "transit".
            var duration = GoogleMapProvider.Instance.GetDuration(startLocation, endLocation, mode, false);
            Console.WriteLine("Duration: " + duration.duration + " seconds");
        }
    }
}
```

This code will calculate the distance and duration of a route between San Francisco, CA and Oakland, CA using the driving mode of transportation. It will output the distance in meters and the duration in seconds to the console. You can customize the code to calculate the distance and duration between additional locations, or to use different modes of transportation. You can also customize the code to display the results in a different format or to store the results in variables for further processing.
