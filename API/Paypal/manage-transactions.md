### Manage transactions

To manage transactions in C# using the PayPal API, you can use the following steps:

1. Sign up for a PayPal developer account and obtain an API client ID and secret.
2. Install the PayPal SDK for .NET by adding it to your project via NuGet or by downloading and installing it manually.
3. Import the PayPal SDK namespace in your C# code:

```csharp
using PayPal.Api;
```

4. Create a new APIContext object using your client ID and secret:

```csharp
APIContext apiContext = new APIContext(clientId, clientSecret, "sandbox"); 
```
Replace "clientId" and "clientSecret" with your own client ID and secret, and use "sandbox" for testing.

5. Retrieve a transaction (by ID):

```csharp
Transaction transaction = Transaction.Get(apiContext, "TRANSACTION_ID");
Console.WriteLine("Transaction ID: " + transaction.id);
```

6. Refund a transaction:

```csharp
Amount refundAmount = new Amount();
refundAmount.currency = "USD";
refundAmount.total = "10.00";
Refund refund = new Refund();
refund.amount = refundAmount;
Refund createdRefund = transaction.Refund(apiContext, refund);
Console.WriteLine("Refund ID: " + createdRefund.id);

```

7. Cancel a transaction:

```csharp
bool success = transaction.Cancel(apiContext);
Console.WriteLine("Transaction Cancelled: " + success);
```

These are just a few examples of how you can use the PayPal API to manage transactions in C#. You can use the API to retrieve, refund, and cancel transactions, as well as to search for and retrieve transaction details. The sample code provided will retrieve a transaction by ID, refund a transaction, and cancel a transaction. You can also use the API to refund and cancel other types of transactions, like an authorize, or capture.
