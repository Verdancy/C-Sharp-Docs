### Retrieve and display lists of followers, friends, and likes for a user
To retrieve and display lists of followers, friends, and likes for a user using the Twitter API in C#, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Set up a project in the Twitter Developer Dashboard and obtain a set of API keys and access tokens.
2. Install the Twitter API client library for C#. You can do this using the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio or by downloading the library from nuget.org.
3. Create a new C# console application and include the necessary using statements for the Twitter API client library.
4. In your application, create a new TwitterService object and set the API keys and access tokens that you obtained in step 1.
5. To retrieve the list of followers for a user, call the Followers.GetFollowers method on the TwitterService object, passing in the user's screen name or user ID as a parameter.
6. To retrieve the list of friends for a user, call the Friends.GetFriends method on the TwitterService object, passing in the user's screen name or user ID as a parameter.
7. To retrieve the list of likes for a user, call the Favorites.GetFavorites method on the TwitterService object, passing in the user's screen name or user ID as a parameter.
8. Iterate through the list of User objects that are returned and display the desired information for each user, such as the name, screen name, and profile image URL.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to do this:

```csharp
using Tweetinvi;
using Tweetinvi.Models;

namespace TwitterAPI
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Set the API keys and access tokens.
            Auth.SetUserCredentials("API_KEY", "API_SECRET", "ACCESS_TOKEN", "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET");

            // Retrieve the list of followers.
            // var followers = Followers.GetFollowers("USERNAME"); // Replace "USERNAME" with the desired user's screen name.
            // var followers = Followers.GetFollowers(USER_ID); // Replace "USER_ID" with the desired user's ID.

            // Retrieve the list of friends.
            // var friends = Friends.GetFriends("USERNAME"); // Replace "USERNAME" with the desired user's screen name.
            // var friends = Friends.GetFriends(USER_ID); // Replace "USER_ID" with the desired user's ID.

            // Retrieve the list of likes.
            // var likes = Favorites.GetFavorites("USERNAME"); // Replace "USERNAME" with the desired user's screen name.
            // var likes = Favorites.GetFavorites(USER_ID); // Replace "USER_ID" with the desired user's ID.

            // Iterate through the list of users and display the desired information.
            foreach (var user in followers)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Name: " + user.Name);
                Console.WriteLine("Username: " + user.ScreenName);
                Console.WriteLine("Profile image URL: " + user.ProfileImageUrl);
                Console.WriteLine("-------------------");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code will retrieve the list of followers, friends, or likes for the specified user, depending on which method you call. It will then iterate through the list of User objects and display the name, screen name, and profile image URL for each user. You can customize the code to display any other desired information about the users.
